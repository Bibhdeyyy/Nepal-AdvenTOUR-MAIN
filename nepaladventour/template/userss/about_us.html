          <hr style="border-top: 2px solid white;"> 
          <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.75;color: whitesmoke">Scrum is an agile framework designed to optimize project management and execution, prominently used in software development and other dynamic fields. It structures work into sprints—short, focused periods typically lasting two to four weeks—during which cross-functional teams collaborate to complete predetermined sets of tasks. This modular approach allows for frequent reassessment and adjustment of project goals, promoting efficiency and adaptability. The continuous delivery of incremental product features ensures steady progress and the ability to adapt to changing requirements.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.75;color: whitesmoke">Within the Scrum framework, three pivotal roles—Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Development Team—drive the process. The Product Owner defines project goals and prioritizes tasks, ensuring the team’s efforts align with customer needs. The Scrum Master facilitates the process, helping to remove impediments and coaching the team in agile practices. Lastly, the Development Team, being self-organizing and multidisciplinary, works collaboratively to deliver high-quality outputs. Together, these roles embody Scrum’s principles of transparency, inspection, and adaptation, crucial for delivering superior results in today’s fast-paced work environments.</p>
